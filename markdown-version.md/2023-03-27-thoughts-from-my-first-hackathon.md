Yesterday I attended my first all-day hackathon, [the Seattle AI Hackathon at SURF](https://www.meetup.com/startupfriends/events/292284155/). I knew that hackathons would be part of my future in software engineering, and was happy to see that in-person ones were starting back up, because looking at the Brady Bunch PC screen version of meetings for the last three years was really grating on me. It turns out that I had joined something possibly more monumentous than just any hackathon - one of the first dedicated to exploiting the new AI technology offered by Large Language models (LLM), especially the first to market, OpenAI's GPT models.

## It's about to be the late 90s all over again

As a high school student in Seattle in the mid and late 90s, I witnessed the beginning of the modern World Wide Web, and the software business upheaval that went along with it. Suddenly there were two kinds of tech companies: modern ones that had a .com in their name and dinosaurs that did not. Over the coming years or possibly months, there will be software companies that integrate "AI" into their user experience (and probably their name), and dinosaurs. I saw and participated in the beginning of what forms the AI experience may take.

## Not Just about chatting

When it comes to the new world of AI, ChatGPT has dominated the public space. Software that can talk to you like a human has always been the most captivating application of language models, and most of the projects were indeed built around this, but not all of them. I saw projects to use language models to search and refine human speech as well, to set priorities on incoming communications, break apart tasks into their components, and create smart transcripts, My team's project, which won second place, involved making product manuals more searchable. Modest, down-to-earth applications and wild, exuberant ones were side-by-side.

## What is "AI" going to mean?

As a linguist, I need to remind myself that what is being called AI is really much more specific: software systems designed to predict the next word that a human will write. If one is going to ascribe general intelligence or even sentience to that, it sounds like a claim that intelligence is nothing but communication ability. But I know that society at large, and the media, probably aren't going to of think it that way. We're entering a wild time where the definition of intelligence will evolve in new and unexpected ways. What a time to be alive.

More on the hackathon itself later.
